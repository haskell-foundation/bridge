Foundation-edge
===============

This package is useful to convert to and from, types and data structure commonly found in
the haskell ecosystem.

For now, edge support the following packages:

* bytestring (initial)
* text (initial)

And planning to add support to:

* vector

If you think edge would benefits from other packages, open an issue (or even better a PR) with
suggestion of what to add.
